# KOReader "Applications"
This is a collection of non-official "applications" designed for KOReader: plugins, scripts or whatever can be easily integrated with KOReader.
These applications are in general less commonly used and not part of core logic KOReader would like to maintain. They may stop working after updating KOReader.

To users:
* Since you are here, you may know how KOReader works. "Applications" in this collections may have different ways to install. For example, plugins can be placed into koreader/plugins folder directly; scripts can be executed pretty much everywhere KOReader can access.
* Each application may support only a subset of devices, pay attention to the compatibility.
* If an application stops working after a certain KOReader version, please kindly create an issue with application name and KOReader version, so the owner can fix or remove it.

To developers:
* This is not a dump station of work-in-progress or deprecated features, please ensure it works when merging.
* Each application should be placed within its own folder with a meaningful name.
* Add a README.md / README file to explain the functionality of the application; if it works with certain devices, add a compatibility section in the README or a COMPATIBILITY file.
* Add an OWNER file if you'd like to maintain it, otherwise if it is broken, it may be removed.
* Installation of applications should be as simple as possible.
